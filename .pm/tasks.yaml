            This would add an entry to the timesheet.yaml file, and have "active"
            be true, and not have an end time. Options:

            -n "task name" -p "parent fragment"

            If you give a parent fragment, it will search to see if that fragment
            is a unique initial sequence. If its not, it asks you to select from the
            matching list it found.

            This would do the same as stop, but also add the "completed:true", and
            mark the current item "done"

            So this would start you working on the most recent thing you were working
            on that wasnt completed.

            This would change  ,,, !!! So Im considering removing this. I dont know
            that it really adds value. I mean, maybe it does, but not atm.

        Somehow I think there should be a notion of "currently active project ...
        ish. or parent." such that instead of defaulting to working in the global
        context, it has you work on this project, whenever you just to "start", without
        any options. And if you do "new task", then its make as a child of this currently
        active thing. So I guess that would go in config, wouldnt it.

        Example use case: Coq. Thinking Im working on a particular file, so that would
        be a sub-project I imagine. And I want that to be the "cwd" as it were.

      Man it would be super cool to have this totally vim integrated, so that when
      I'm doing coq proofs I can track my time super well. Man that would be really
      awesome.'

          investigate "roll my own pseudo-yaml" _or_ find another, faster library.
          Because startup time is important.
    notes: "Is there any feasible way of making the startup time faster? Yaml is looking\
      \ like a .3 second drag on the whole show. \n"
